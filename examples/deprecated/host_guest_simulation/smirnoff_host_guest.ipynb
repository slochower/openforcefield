    "\n",
    "This notebook takes a SMILES string for a guest and a 3D structure for a host, and generates an initial structure of the complex using docking. It then proceeds to solvate, parameterize the system, and then minimize and do a short simulation with OpenMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note this is intended for educational purposes and comprises a worked example, not a polished tool. The usual disclaimers apply -- don't take anything here as advice on how you should set up these types of systems; this is just an example of setting up a nontrivial system with SMIRNOFF.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, you're going to need a license to the OpenEye toolkits (free for academics), and have these installed and working, ideally in your anaconda Python distribution. Then you'll also need the `openforcefield` toolkits installed, which you can do via `conda install -c omnia openforcefield` if you are using anaconda Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need the `oenotebook` OpenEye Jupyter notebook library installed, such as via `pip install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/openeye/simple openeye-oenotebook` (but for some particular environments this fails and you might pip install instead from https://pypi.anaconda.org/openeye/label/beta/simple/openeye-oenotebook or see troubleshooting tips in , and `oeommtools`, a library for working with OpenEye/OpenMM in conjunction, which is installable via `conda install -c OpenEye/label/Orion -c omnia`. You also need `pdbfixer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possibly complete set of installation instructions is to download Anaconda 3 and then do something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "./Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "conda install -c omnia openmm openforcefield pdbfixer \n",
    "conda install -c OpenEye/label/Orion -c omnia oeommtools\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge nglview\n",
    "pip install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/openeye/simple openeye-toolkits\n",
    "pip install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/openeye/simple/openeye-oenotebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `nglview` viewing of 3D structures within the notebook, you will likely also need to run `jupyter nbextension install --py nglview-js-widgets --user` and `jupyter-nbextension enable nglview --py --sys-prefix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some platforms may have issues with the `openeye-oenotebook` installation, so a workaround may be something like `pip install https://pypi.anaconda.org/openeye/label/beta/simple/openeye-oenotebook/0.8.1/OpenEye_oenotebook-0.8.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl`.\n",

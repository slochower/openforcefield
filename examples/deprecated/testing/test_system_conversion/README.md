# Testing system conversion for SMIRNOFF

This directory contains an IPython notebook and supporting files working to convert a system into AMBER format after parameterization via SMIRNOFF

## Manifest:
- `convert_to_amber.ipynb`: IPython notebook working towards converting an example SMIRNOFF system (cyclohexane and ethanol mixture) into AMBER format and validating the energy before and after conversion
- ethanol and cyclohexane files

**Converted system files not tracked on github as they are too large**
